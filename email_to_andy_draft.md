**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Extending Copy Content to FH to Support Altyr Platform

Hi Andy,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've been impressed by your "Copy Content to FH" Chrome extension and the seamless migration experience you've built for creators moving content between platforms like OnlyFans, Fansly, and ManyVids.

I'm the founder of **Altyr**, a new creator platform that's building a modern alternative to existing subscription content platforms. We're focused on providing creators with premium UX, advanced analytics/CRM tools, and gamified fan experiences. As we're onboarding our first cohort of creators, one of the biggest friction points we're hearing about is the time and effort required to migrate existing content from platforms like OnlyFans.

Your extension already solves this problem beautifully for several platforms, and I'd love to explore the possibility of extending it to support Altyr as a destination platform. This would:

1. **Help creators** who want to migrate to Altyr save significant time and effort
2. **Expand your tool's reach** to a new, growing platform
3. **Create a win-win partnership** that benefits both our platforms and the creator community

I'm open to discussing various collaboration models:
- **Technical partnership**: We can provide API documentation and technical support to make integration straightforward
- **Revenue sharing**: If you have a monetization model, we're open to discussing terms
- **Co-marketing**: We can promote your tool to our creator community as the recommended migration solution
- **Custom arrangement**: Happy to discuss what would work best for both of us

From a technical perspective, we're building a modern platform with a REST API that supports content uploads, and we'd be happy to work with you to ensure the integration is smooth. We're also open to providing test accounts or sandbox environments if that would be helpful.

Would you be open to a brief call or email exchange to discuss this further? I'm happy to share more details about Altyr, our roadmap, and how we can make this partnership work for both sides.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

## Alternative Shorter Version

**Subject:** Feature Request: Adding Altyr as a Destination Platform

Hi Andy,

I'm the founder of **Altyr**, a new creator platform launching soon. I've been impressed by your "Copy Content to FH" extension and how it simplifies content migration for creators.

We're looking to make onboarding as seamless as possible for creators migrating from OnlyFans and Fansly, and I'd love to explore adding Altyr as a destination platform in your extension.

Would you be open to a quick conversation about this? I'm happy to:
- Provide API documentation and technical support
- Discuss partnership terms (revenue share, co-marketing, etc.)
- Work with you to make the integration as smooth as possible

Let me know if you'd be interested in exploring this. Happy to jump on a call or continue via email.

Best,
