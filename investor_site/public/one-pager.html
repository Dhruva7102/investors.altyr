      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Altyr is building a modern creator platform for subscriptions and premium content. The market is already proven and high-margin
        (OnlyFans generates billions in revenue with 20%+ commission rates) — yet incumbents operate on outdated infrastructure that frustrates
        creators and fans. Altyr pairs a premium UX with creator-grade revenue tooling (CRM, analytics, automations) and a gamified fan journey
        designed to systematically increase spend, retention, and VIP conversion.
      </p>

      <div class="kpi">
        <div><strong>Raise</strong><br />$1.2M Friends &amp; Family SAFE (20% discount)</div>
        <div><strong>Market</strong><br />$50B+ estimated value of top platforms (and expanding)</div>
      </div>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High fees, limited value-add:</strong> creators pay 20%+ commission but get slow payouts, basic analytics, and little help growing revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdated UX:</strong> clunky uploads, poor mobile experiences, and antiquated interfaces hurt conversion and retention.</li>
        <li><strong>Weak discovery and targeting:</strong> basic search and categories make it hard for niche and emerging creators to reach the right fans.</li>
        <li><strong>No creator CRM:</strong> no tools to segment, message, and activate top fans — creators operate in spreadsheets and DMs.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat monetization flows:</strong> tip/subscribe/buy content without designed paths from casual fan to VIP supporter.</li>
        <li><strong>Creators fly blind:</strong> limited real-time insight into what’s working, who the best fans are, and how to engage them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p><strong>Altyr is a creator revenue platform that blends:</strong> modern tech + creator-grade analytics/CRM + gamified fan journeys.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Premium platform UX:</strong> fast uploads, smooth mobile experience, modern onboarding.</li>
        <li><strong>Creator tools &amp; revenue ops:</strong> real-time analytics, high-value fan CRM, segmentation, campaign builder, automations.</li>
        <li><strong>Gamified fan experience:</strong> progression, streaks, quests, VIP tiers, and social proof to drive repeat spending.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Differentiator</h2>
      <p>
        We bring <strong>casino-grade and game-grade monetization design</strong> into the creator ecosystem — paired with modern creator tooling
        (CRM, analytics, revenue ops). This turns the standard 20% commission into a justified investment in technology that meaningfully grows
        creator revenue and increases total market spend.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription and adult content represent a massive, high-margin market. OnlyFans generates billions in revenue with 20%+ commission rates —
        yet operates on infrastructure that looks and behaves like a 2016 web app. The gap between profitability and platform quality creates a clear opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Altyr leverages data-driven insights and proven gamification techniques (gaming, social, e-commerce) to drive more spend, incentivize big spenders
        with progression systems and VIP tiers, and increase total market size over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Go-To-Market</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inner Circle founding cohort:</strong> hand-selected creators receive white-glove setup, migration, and direct roadmap access.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep implementation + case studies:</strong> prove higher LTV per fan, more VIP conversion, and better retention.</li>
        <li><strong>Agencies &amp; managers:</strong> partner to onboard rosters with minimal operational overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Product-led growth:</strong> analytics, public case studies, and creator testimonials drive inbound interest.</li>
      </ul>
